# P-Net-Reproducibility-Paper

This is the implementation of P-NET (a Biologically Informed Neural Network). The code was written by Haitham A Elmarakeby et al. in “Biologically informed deep neural network for prostate cancer discover" (paper link: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03922-4) and adapted to work for Python 3. It is used for three tasks:

1. Prostate Cancer Classification (primary or metastatic) - reproducibility of the results outlined in the paper
2. Tissue type classification - using the adult GTEx dataset
3. Radiosensitivity Prediction - using 511 cell lines from the CCLE dataset

The code has been heavily refactored to allow input datasets to be more easily integrated for experiments beyond the original Prostate Cancer Classification task. Issues around reproducibility of results have also been fixed and the pipeline and configuration has been cleaned up to ensure that settings within the configuration files will influence each run where previously sometimes there was overriding of parameters hidden in the pipeline. The pipeline has also been designed to be more extensible, allowing users to write their own functions to be inserted at different stages of the pipeline for the purposes of experiments and are described below

## Installation

### Windows / Linux
Recommended to install with some kind of environment managing software like conda

```
conda create --name pnet-repro python=3.10
conda activate pnet-repro
```
Install the CUDA toolkit and cuDNN for GPU support before installing requirements
```
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1
```
Install requirements file from the root directory of the repository
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS (Apple Silicon)
TensorFlow on Apple Silicon requires the `tensorflow-macos` and `tensorflow-metal` packages instead of the standard `tensorflow`. The metal plugin version must be pinned to match the TensorFlow version.

```
conda create --name pnet-repro python=3.10
conda activate pnet-repro
```
Install TensorFlow and the Metal GPU plugin separately before the rest of the requirements
```
pip install tensorflow-macos==2.10.0 tensorflow-metal==0.6.0
```
Then install the remaining requirements
```
pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
```

All scripts should be run from the root directory rather than from the individual experiment folders. If you are running the radiosensitivity experiment scripts you will also need to have R installed with tidyverse.

## Datasets
Pre-processed datasets for the experiments can be downloaded from 10.5281/zenodo.17340266. Unzip and put the data folder in each experiment's root folder then execute the run_all.py script.

## Structure of the repository
All code pertaining to P-Net and supporting pipeline can be found in the architecture folder. All other folders are experiment specific and this is the intended way to use the repository.

### Architecture
1. pnet_model.py - contains the code for constructing TensorFlow implementation of P-Net from Reactome.
2. pipeline.py - contains code for the pipeline object that is used to configure and run experiments with P-Net and other models. MLPipeline is used for any sklearn type model and TFPipeline is used for P-Net but in general the Pipeline class is designed such that you can subclass it and override _train to do any platform / framework specific changes before fitting the model.
3. data_utils.py - contains code for the classes used for loading multiple views of a dataset and integrates them for use with P-Net and other models. Features from multiple views are aligned according to alignment_ids and they features of the same alignment_id are kept contiguously when concatenated together.
4. layers_custom.py - contains Diagonal and SparseTF which are mostly unchanged from the original P-Net repository
5. callbacks_custom.py - callback functions to be used with tensorflow models, mostly unchanged from the original P-Net repository
6. coef_weights_utils.py - functions to help with extracting coefficients and outputs from the tensorflow model layers for the purpose of deeplift / explainability. Mostly unchanged from original P-Net repository
7. deepexplain - folder containing deepexplain / deeplift code. Mostly unchanged from original P-Net repository
8. Reactome - folder containing the reactome data used by P-Net. Unchanged from the original P-Net repository
9. evaluation.py - contains functions that are attached to the results_processors variable in the configuration file to allow flexibility in what kinds of evaluations to perform on each run e.g AUC, accuracy, F1, train history, deeplift etc.
10. pnet_config.py - template configuration file with values set to what was specified in the P-Net paper (which is not necessarily the same as in the original P-Net github repository). Gives an idea of what is available for configuration and what are expected inputs

### Usage
The code is meant to be used by importing / copying the pnet_config.py file and editing it to suit your experiment needs. There are a few config options that are experiment specific and listed below
1. run_id - specifies the tag for the current experiment run
2. data_dir - path to the folder containing all the data for the experiments
3. run_dir - path to the folder you wish to store all the outputs of your experiments
4. views - list of tuples containing paths to the datasets you wish to load in, as well as an identifying tag for what kind of data view it is and functions to preprocess the data and extract alignment_ids from the headers
5. view_alignment_method - a string to specify how to deal with NAs when aligning different views
6. labels - the response variables you wish to make a prediction for
   
The pipeline has 2 run methods. The first method is run_single_split. This is used when you do not want to do full crossvalidation, and lets you split the data into train, validation, and test sets either based on a random seed or a lists of sample ids for each split. To specify these splits you need to set the following config variables
1. train_samples - either a list of sample ids or a float between 0 and 1 specifying the size of train set
2. val_samples - either a list of sample ids or a float between 0 and 1 specifying the size of validation set
3. test_samples - either a list of sample ids or a float between 0 and 1 specifying the size of train samples
   
The second method is run_crossvalidation. For this you will need to specify a few extra config variables
1. tv_split_seed - random seed to make train-validation split reproducible
2. inner_kfolds - number of train-validation splits to compute per test split
3. outer_kfolds - number of development-test splits for the crossvalidation
4. validation_prop - a float specifying proportion of the development set to be used for validation. Only used if inner_kfolds is set to 1
#### Customisable entry points
The pipeline was designed to let users customise different steps in the model development pipeline beyond specifying parameters and hyperparameters of the model.
1. feature_selector - a class that follows the same format as a sklearn model e.g with fit, fit_transform, transform methods. The purpose of this entry point is to let users define a feature selection method that can be applied during each crossvalidation training run data independently and then apply the feature selection to the validation and test sets when evaluating
2. data_augmentor - a function that takes in the training dataset and outputs an augmented training dataset e.g with artificial new data points
3. results_processors - a list of functions that are run after a model for a training run has been completed. This can be various metrics, plotting training history, saving model weights etc.
   
#### Grid search
Grid searching can be done by specifying the desired parameters to gridsearch over in a dictionary where each config item that you want to gridsearch over is a key in the dictionary and the value is a dictionary of the parameters to be searched. The keys of the inner dictionary are just identifiers for that particular parameter setting and the value is the actual value you want to gridsearch over. You then use construct_gs_params on this dictionary and assign the output to grid_search variable in the config
